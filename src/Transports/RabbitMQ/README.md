# Cambion.Transport.RabbitMQ
Cambion is a lightweight distributed application framework with multiple and pluggable backends, providing a set of convenience functions for event handling. If you have one application that needs to talk to another application, either on the same computer, or even on a different computer, you can't use the default loopback backend provided with Cambion.
This transport provider uses [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) to send data between instances of Cambion.

## Installation
Cambion.Transport.RabbitMQ is available on  [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Whitestone.Cambion.Transport.RabbitMQ/) so you can install it in the NuGet Package Manager Console:
```
Install-Package Whitestone.Cambion.Transport.RabbitMQ
```

## Documentation

Documentation for the RabbitMQ transport is available on the [Cambion documentation site](https://cambion.readthedocs.io/en/latest)
